For a fully automated build process execute the build.sh bash script located in
the scripts folder. For information about proper usage execute "./build.sh -h".

We currently supply a native linux build and a windows cross-compilation build
via mingw-64 under linux. There is also 64 bit and a 32 bit compile option. You
can either build the full engine which works with the builtin event system
driven by symbolic tiles in the Tiled map file. The other option is to build the
library version with stripped event functionality which you can link into your
own projects.

Note: When compiling the linux32 version it will break your 64 bit sdl2 dev libs
      so make sure to reinstall sdl2 afterwards to avoid hiccups later on.
