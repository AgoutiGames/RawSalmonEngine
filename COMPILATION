For Linux 32bit cross-compilation:
    $ sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib zlib1g-dev:i386 libb64-dev:i386 libtinyxml2-dev:i386
    
    This may break your 64bit SDL2 install which you'll typically want to reinstall after
    $ sudo apt install libsdl2-dev:i386 libsdl2-image-dev:i386 libsdl2-mixer-dev:i386 libsdl2-ttf-dev:i386 
    
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../cmake/linux32-toolchain.cmake" ../
    
For Linux windows cross compilation with mingw-w64:
    make sure to pull "dependencies" submodule or build libraries yourself
    
    $ sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
    
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../cmake/win64-toolchain.cmake" ../
    or
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../cmake/win32-toolchain.cmake" ../
    
    Dont' forget: To run the executable you'll have to put all dlls into the same folder as the exe.
