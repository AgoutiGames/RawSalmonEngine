For a fully automated build process execute the build.sh bash script located in
the scripts folder. For information about proper usage execute "./build.sh -h".

We currently supply a native linux build and a windows cross-compilation build
via mingw-64 under linux. There is also 64 bit and a 32 bit compile option.

Note: When compiling the linux32 version it will break your 64 bit sdl2 dev libs
      so make sure to reinstall sdl2 afterwards to avoid hiccups later on.

Scripts located in ./scripts folder:

                            project via aptitude
